# ADC-UART-Communication-System
This project involves designing a data acquisition system using the ATmega324PA microcontroller. It integrates an ADC for reading input values, displays data on an LCD, and transmits the data via UART. The system is optimized for efficient real-time data transmission and display using interrupts and double buffering techniques.
